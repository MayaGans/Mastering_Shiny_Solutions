<span style="font-size:18px">My attempt to answer the exercises from [Hadley Wickham's Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/). I'd gladly welcome thoughts, comments, and suggestions on my [website repo](https://github.com/MayaGans/BayesianBabe/tree/master/content/MasteringShiny/example)!</span>

Anywhere you see a question box I'm unsure of my solution or have a question about the exercise!
